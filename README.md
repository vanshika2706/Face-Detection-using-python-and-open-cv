Face Detection using python and open cv 
# 👁️‍🗨️ Face Detection Using Python & OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV via webcam. It uses the Haar Cascade Classifier provided by OpenCV to detect human faces in live video stream and draw rectangles around them.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Conversion of live video frames from BGR to grayscale
- Haar Cascade classifier for accurate face localization
- Rectangle overlay on detected faces
- Easily extendable for image input or further feature detection (eyes, smiles, etc.)

## 📁 Files

- `Face_Detection_using_python.py`: Main Python script for running face detection using your system’s webcam.
- `output.jpg`: (Optional) Saved image with detected face rectangles, if enabled in code.

## 💻 Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

Install with pip:
